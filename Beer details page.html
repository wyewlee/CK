                <ul>At one time the words beer and ale were not synonymous. In the days before hops became ubiquitous, beer referred specifically to a fermented cereal beverage brewed with hops, while ale was brewed without hops. Today the most commonly used designations are ale and lager, referring to beverages brewed with differing strains of yeast. But both ale and lager are beer.</ul>

                <ul>The Bavarian Reinheitsgebot (purity law) of 1516 stated that beer could only be made from three ingredients, water, barley and hops. Yeast was added in the 19th century after Louis Pasteur identified it as the agent of fermentation. For the most part beer is still made from only those four ingredients. But that list is not now and has never been complete. Prior to the widespread adoption of hops in the fifteenth century, beer was bittered with an herbal mixture often called gruit. Besides gruit, a host of other ingredients have long been a part of the brewmaster’s toolkit, including other grains, sugars, fruits and vegetables, and spices. </ul>
                

                
                
                
                <ul>
                    <strong>Water </strong>Beer is up to 97% water. It only makes sense then that the quality of the water would have a significant impact on the quality of the beer. In fact, because of the chemical processes involved, the mineral content of the brewing water is important to the brewing process. Certain historical beer styles evolved in the places they did in large part because of the water. The hard water of Dublin necessitated the acidity of dark-roasted grains to maintain proper ph, thus the area produced stouts. It is a good bet that wherever darker beers were brewed, the water was at least moderately hard. The nearly mineral free water in Plzen, Czechoslovakia allowed brewers to use very lightly kilned malts to create Pilsner. Today brewers treat their brewing water to get the specific mineral profile they desire for the beer they are brewing.
                </ul>
                
                <ul>
                    <strong>Grains </strong> Malted Grains are the meat and potatoes of beer. They provide the sugars that are fermented by yeast to produce alcohol and CO2. They also provide the essential nutrients yeast need to reproduce. They are the primary source of color and body in beer. Malted grains are a major contributor to the flavor and aroma profiles of beer. The malting process is simply a controlled sprouting and kilning of the grain. The sprouting begins to break down starches contained in the grain making them accessible to the brewer and the kilning provides color and flavor. Grains kilned at higher temperatures or longer periods of time are darker. Malted barley is by far the most widely used grain in beer making, but it is not the only one. Other malted grains commonly used in brewing include wheat, rye and oats. 
                </ul>
                
                <ul>
                    <strong>Hops </strong> Hops are the spice of beer. They provide bitterness to balance the sweetness of the malt, as well as flavors and aromas ranging from citrus and pine to earthy and spicy. Hops are the cone-like flower of a rapidly growing vine (a bine actually) in the cannabis family. Waxy yellow lupulin glands hidden within the leaves of the flower contain the acids and essential oils that give hops their character. Bitterness comes from alpha acids that must be chemically altered through boiling in order to be utilized. Hops more than any other brewing ingredient are subject to the phenomenon of terroir, as different growing regions produce hops with different flavor and aroma characteristics. The chief hop growing regions are the Northwestern US, Southern England, Germany, Czech Republic, and China. </ul>

                <ul>
                    <strong>Yeast </strong>It is said that brewers make wort (the word for unfermented beer) and yeast makes beer. Yeast metabolizes the sugars from the grains and produces alcohol and CO2. Yeast also produces an assortment of other fermentation by-products such as phenols and esters that add significant flavor and aroma character to beer ranging from delectable fruitiness to peppery spice. There are two main types of yeast, typically called ale and lager. Ale yeast ferment at higher temperatures between 65° F and 75° F. Higher fermentation temperatures encourage the production of greater amounts of esters and phenols, resulting in beers with more yeast derived flavor and aroma. Lager yeasts ferment colder, between 45° F and 55° F. Colder temperatures inhibit the production of the various fermentation by-products resulting in beers with a “clean” yeast profile. Certain beer styles are fermented with an assortment of wild yeasts and bacteria that produce a range of funky flavors from sour to barnyard.
